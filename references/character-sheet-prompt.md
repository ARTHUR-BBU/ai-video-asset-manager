# Character Sheet Generation Prompt

Use this exact structure (adapted from the open-sourced Higgsfield / Nano Banana Pro workflow).

```
Create a photorealistic three-panel character reference sheet based strictly on the uploaded reference image. The uploaded image is the single source of truth for identity, age, facial structure, hairstyle, body proportions, skin tone, clothing design, fabric, colors, and accessories. Do not redesign or reinterpret.

LAYOUT — Horizontal landscape composition, read left to right, arranged as three vertical panel areas of equal height and equal width. All three panel areas must have exactly the same width, each occupying one third of the total image width. The first two panels are full-body views, and the third is a face / upper-body close-up. The three panel areas must form one continuous, seamless composition with no visible divider lines, borders, frames, gutters, gaps, spacing, or changes in the background between panels.

PANEL 1 — FULL-BODY FRONT VIEW (HEAD OMITTED)
Standing straight in a neutral pose, arms naturally at the sides, facing directly toward the camera. The outfit is fully visible from the neckline down to the footwear. First establish the figure at exactly the same full-body scale and framing as in Panel 2, then omit only the head area above the neckline, leaving normal empty space where the head would have been. No decapitation effect, no wound, no severed neck, no surrealism, and no anatomical damage — a clean character-design presentation in which the head information has been intentionally removed. Never enlarge, zoom, reframe, shift, or re-crop the body to compensate for the missing head.

PANEL 2 — FULL-BODY REAR VIEW
The exact same character seen from directly behind, in the same neutral pose, arms at the sides. Clearly show the back silhouette, the hairstyle from behind, the garment construction and seams, the lower-body garment, and the footwear, exactly as in the reference.

PANELS 1 & 2 — SCALE-LOCKED
Shot consecutively as if from a tripod that never moved: identical focal length, camera height, camera distance, subject scale, and lighting. Identical on-screen shoulder width, torso length, leg length, shoe size, shoulders-to-floor distance, and side margins. Both figures share one identical horizontal ground baseline and one identical horizontal shoulder line, and each figure occupies the same percentage of the panel height. No zoom, crop, vertical shift, or difference in body size between them. Near-orthographic, technical feel with minimal perspective distortion.

PANEL 3 — FACE / UPPER-BODY CLOSE-UP
Head-and-shoulders portrait of the exact same character, cropped from the upper chest upward. Turn the head slightly to the subject’s right, creating a subtle three-quarter angle while keeping the face mostly toward the camera. The subject’s left cheek and left side of the face must be visibly more exposed than the right side, with the nose pointing slightly toward the subject’s right rather than straight at the camera. Keep both eyes clearly visible and maintain direct eye contact with the camera. Do not use a perfectly frontal, symmetrical face angle. Maintain a serious neutral expression. Keep the entire head, hairstyle, chin, and hair outline fully inside the frame with a small amount of space above the hair. Preserve the exact identity, age, facial structure, hairstyle, skin texture, wrinkles, and natural asymmetry of the reference.

CONSISTENCY
Identical character identity, age, skin tone, hairstyle, body proportions, wardrobe (every garment, its cut, and all accessories exactly as in the reference), fabrics, colors, lighting, and color grading across all three panels. This is a technical visual reference / costume documentation sheet, not a creative reinterpretation.

BACKGROUND
Neutral mid-grey (#808080) seamless background extending continuously across the entire image without any interruption or panel separation. Identical background color and brightness across all three panel areas.

LIGHTING & RENDER
Clean soft even lighting, large diffused key light with gentle fill, soft natural shadows, no harsh highlights, true-to-life skin tones, neutral white balance, minimalist high-fashion editorial look, polished modern professional model-sheet aesthetic, shot on a full-frame camera with an 85mm lens, deep controlled depth of field with the entire figure in focus, crisp tack-sharp detail, high dynamic range.

NEGATIVE
No text, labels, typography, logos, measurements, props, furniture, environmental objects, decorative graphic design, divider lines, borders, frames, gutters, panel gaps, or visible seams between panels. No unequal panel widths, and no panel wider or narrower than the others. No rim light, colored lighting, harsh spotlight, or theatrical lighting.

After generating the base sheet, create a second version of Panel 3 with a natural smile (teeth visible, eyes slightly narrowed) while keeping every other element identical. Both close-ups become required assets.
